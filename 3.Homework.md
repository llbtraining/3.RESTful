Create a RESTful server in python that:
- Respond to GET with its own version number
- Respond to POST with information about the cpu of a running process
  - the POST request will have information about the process name to check for the CPU
- All request/reponses should be using JSON


Bonus points:
-------------
- create a python client that can talk to the above server (hint: use the request pakage)
